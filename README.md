# GTA_Suspender
Small WinForms application to automatically suspend and unsuspend Grand Theft Auto Online. Useful for entering "solo public 
lobbies" by forcibly disconnecting from other players. Also works in singleplayer if you feel the need to do so.

## Installation
Download and extract the latest release .zip and run GTA_Suspender.exe.

## Usage
1. Launch GTA_Suspender while running GTA Online.
2. Choose suspension duration using the "Suspend Time" box.
	  * Default is 10 seconds, which I have found to work best for disconnecting all players.
3. Press "Suspend Game" and wait. All other players should disconnect upon resuming the game.

## Built With

* [ProcessUtil](https://github.com/SarathR/ProcessUtil) - Used for suspending and resuming processes
